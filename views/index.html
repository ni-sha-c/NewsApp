			The Literary Section does IIT Roorkee proud! IITR was ranked 4th overall in Nihilant, the yearly quizzing fest purely for the IITs and IIMs! IIMA, IIML and IITK were ranked first, second and third respectively. Haaris Matein (IV Chem), Vishal Battula (IV EE) and Abhinav Malhotra (IV Chem) fended off tough competition from all the teams to win the Biz Quiz. In addition to this, IITR was the only team other than IIML and IIMA to qualify for the final round of all quizzes!
		</p>
		<p>
		The first edition of Nav Umang turned out to be great success, with participation from all hostels from both campuses! The overall rankings are as follows: 1. Malviya Bhawan 2. Cautley Bhawan 3. Jawahar Bhawan

		<p><!--Coffee is not my cup of tea. Well, let me rephrase that - North Indian coffee is not my cup of tea. Call me racist, but when the concentration of sugar in the coffee crosses a 1000 PPM, I believe it's time to empty the cup in the nearest gutter. Which is precisely why I refuse to drink the murky, diabetes inducing saccharine solution they serve in the canteens by the name of coffee. So, the only thing that keeps me awake during those caffeine deprived all-nighters that I pull (strictly for nonacademic purposes, I assure you) is coffee's fairer yet fouler tasting cousin, tea. What does all this nonsense have to do with this column, you ask? Well, election season just got over and I wanted to remind the bhawan secy that putting up a coffee vending machine on the sixth floor of RKB could be just that crucial in securing that very important vote for his re-election next year. Kidding, of course. The only reason I chose to mention the fact that a caffeine addict, who swore by coffee in the pre-JEE era, has now turned to the dark side, is because it is one of the many things that remind me of how much I have changed after coming to Roorkee.


And a change in my beverage preferences is just the metaphorical tip of the iceberg. Well, I guess that's what two years in Roorkee do to you. I can hardly claim to have stepped into R as a naive, wide-eyed fachcha with dreams that touched the sky. Yet, should I look back at a two year younger me, I'm sure I would hardly recognize him. A friend once told me that a sure indicator of 'growing up' was one's music playlist. My iPod playlist has more songs of Pink Floyd than Coldplay now. It's been ages since the odd Linkin Park song was deleted. The Jeffrey Archers and Dan Browns on my bookshelf have now been replaced by difficult-to-pronounce Russian and European names. As far as comparison between grades is concerned, the lesser said the better. That characteristic zest that is unique to every JEE aspirant has now been
replaced by nonchalance, to the point of insouciance even. I honestly can't say if all of this constitutes 'growing up'. But change? Sure I have. The wave of change hasn't spared the insti either. In my own time, I have seen the rise of RKB, the birth of LAN, the replacement of ABN, and of course, Thomso making the headlines. As clichÃ©d as it may sound, change, it seems, is indeed inevitable.


Elsewhere, as the spirit of rebellion and the winds of change engulf the country, the zeitgeist of the times dictates that I add my own sagacious views to the growing medley of erudite opinions and cogent analyses that are already doing the rounds on Facebook and the blogosphere. But then, considering that the readers' patience has already been stretched thin, owing largely to the above GRE-esque verbal douchebaggery, I'd be wise to desist. Instead, in this issue, we  talk about the various social initiatives that exist in R, and the student involvement in them. We also explore the working and various functions of the recently innovated and much hyped Greater Noida Extension Campus. Phew! Finally, something newsworthy, eh? Sigh. Another midsem lurks around the corner. On the brighter side though, so does Diwali..--></p>
